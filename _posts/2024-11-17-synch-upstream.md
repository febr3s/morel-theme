# Git merge explained

### Imagine You’re Playing with Lego Sets

1. **You Have Your Own Lego Set**: 
   - This is your project (let's call it **My Project**). You build cool things with it, and it’s unique to you.

2. **Your Friend Has a Lego Set Too**: 
   - This is like the original project (we’ll call it **Original Project**). Your friend builds awesome things with their set.

3. **You Borrow Your Friend’s Lego Set**: 
   - You take a copy of your friend’s Lego set to build your own new things. This is called **forking** in the Git world. Now you have **My Project** (your copy) based on **Original Project** (your friend’s set).

4. **Your Friend Adds New Pieces to Their Lego Set**: 
   - Your friend keeps adding cool new pieces and structures to **Original Project**. You want those new pieces too!

### How Do You Get Those New Pieces?

#### Using Upstream in Git is Like Staying Updated with Your Friend's Lego Set

1. **Add Your Friend’s Set as Upstream**:
   - You tell your Lego set, "Hey, keep an eye on the cool things my friend is doing!" This is like adding the **upstream** remote. In Git, you add your friend’s repository as upstream:
     ```sh
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/friend/original-project.git
     ```

2. **Check for New Pieces from Your Friend**:
   - Every now and then, you look at what new things your friend has built. This is called **fetching**:
     ```sh
     git fetch upstream
     ```

3. **Mix New Pieces with Your Own Creations**:
   - You combine the new pieces from your friend with what you’ve built. Sometimes, you have to figure out how to fit the new pieces with your own creations. This is called **merging**:
     ```sh
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

#### Step-by-Step in Git Language

1. **Adding Upstream Remote**:
   - Telling Git where your friend’s repository is:
     ```sh
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/friend/original-project.git
     ```

2. **Fetching Changes**:
   - Getting the latest updates from your friend’s repository:
     ```sh
     git fetch upstream
     ```

3. **Merging Changes**:
   - Combining those updates with your own project:
     ```sh
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

4. **Solving Conflicts**:
   - If your new pieces and your friend’s new pieces don’t fit together perfectly, you’ll have to adjust them (resolve conflicts).

#### Putting It All Together

1. **You Have Your Project (Fork)**:
   - Your unique project where you create your own things.

2. **Friend’s Project is Upstream**:
   - The original project where new cool things are added.

3. **Stay Updated**:
   - Regularly check and incorporate the new things from upstream into your project to keep it fresh and updated.

This way, you can enjoy building with both your unique pieces and the cool new pieces your friend adds to their set!



# Solving conflicts

Sure! Let's go through an example of resolving conflicts step-by-step:

### Scenario

Imagine you have a project (repository B) where you’ve added some new content to a website. The original project (repository A) has made some structural changes that you want to incorporate into your project.

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Your Changes in Repository B**:
   - You added a new section to your website, `index.html`:
     ```html
     <!-- index.html in repository B -->
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>My Website</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
         <p>Content added by me.</p>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

2. **Changes in Repository A**:
   - The original project (repository A) updated the `index.html` to include a new footer:
     ```html
     <!-- index.html in repository A -->
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>My Website</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
         <footer>© 2024 Example Corp</footer>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Fetching Changes from Upstream**:
   - You fetch the latest changes from repository A (upstream):
     ```sh
     git fetch upstream
     ```

4. **Merging Changes**:
   - You try to merge the changes from the upstream repository into your repository:
     ```sh
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

### Conflict Occurs

Git identifies that both you and the upstream repository made changes to the `index.html` file. This causes a conflict, and Git marks the conflict areas in the file like this:

```html
<!-- index.html with conflict markers -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    <p>Content added by me.</p>
    =======
    <footer>© 2024 Example Corp</footer>
    >>>>>>> upstream/main
  </body>
</html>
```

### Resolving the Conflict

You open `index.html` in your text editor and decide how to combine the changes. You want to keep both your content and the new footer from the upstream repository. You edit the file to look like this:

```html
<!-- index.html resolved -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Content added by me.</p>
    <footer>© 2024 Example Corp</footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Marking the Conflict as Resolved

After making the necessary edits, you mark the file as resolved:

```sh
git add index.html
```

### Committing the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved and marked, you commit the merge:

```sh
git commit -m "Merged changes from upstream repository"
```

### Pushing the Changes to Your Repository

Finally, you push the changes to your remote repository:

```sh
git push origin main
```

### Summary

- **Conflict**: Git tells you there’s a conflict because both you and the upstream repository changed the same part of `index.html`.
- **Resolve**: You manually edit `index.html` to keep both your content and the new footer.
- **Mark Resolved**: You tell Git that you’ve resolved the conflict.
- **Commit and Push**: You commit the merge and push the changes to your repository.

This way, you successfully integrate the new structural changes from the upstream repository without losing your unique content.



# Making conflict solving less messy

Yes, resolving merge conflicts can sometimes be a bit tedious, especially if there are many conflicts. However, there are several strategies and tools that can help you manage this process more efficiently:

### Strategies to Manage Merge Conflicts

1. **Frequent Syncing**:
   - Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. This reduces the number of changes and potential conflicts each time you merge.
   
2. **Clear Separation of Changes**:
   - Try to keep your changes and the upstream changes in separate parts of the project as much as possible. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts.

3. **Small, Incremental Changes**:
   - Make small, incremental changes and commit them frequently. This makes it easier to resolve conflicts since changes are isolated and easier to track.

### Tools to Help with Merge Conflicts

1. **Git GUI Tools**:
   - Tools like GitKraken, SourceTree, or GitHub Desktop can help visualize and resolve conflicts more easily.

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:
   - Many modern IDEs (like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) have built-in tools for resolving merge conflicts, making the process more intuitive.

3. **Merge Tools**:
   - Command-line tools like `git mergetool` can be configured to use external merge tools like KDiff3, Meld, or Beyond Compare to help resolve conflicts more efficiently.

### Example Using Git and VS Code

Let’s go through a more practical example using Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes from Upstream**:
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **Merge the Changes from Upstream**:
   ```sh
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. **Open VS Code**:
   ```sh
   code .
   ```

4. **Resolve Conflicts in VS Code**:
   - VS Code will highlight the conflicted files and show conflict markers within the files.
   - Use the provided options in VS Code to accept incoming changes, current changes, or both, and manually edit as needed.

5. **Mark Conflicts as Resolved**:
   After resolving conflicts in VS Code, mark the files as resolved:
   ```sh
   git add path/to/conflicted-file
   ```

6. **Commit the Merge**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Merged changes from upstream repository"
   ```

7. **Push the Changes to Your Repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Automated Tools and Scripts

If the conflicts are frequent and follow a certain pattern, you can create scripts to automate part of the conflict resolution process. However, automation should be used carefully to avoid introducing errors.

### Summary

- **Preparation**: Sync frequently, make small changes, and keep clear separation.
- **Use Tools**: Utilize Git GUI tools, IDEs, and merge tools to streamline the process.
- **Manual Resolution**: Sometimes manual intervention is unavoidable, but tools can make it easier.

By using these strategies and tools, you can manage merge conflicts more effectively and keep your workflow smooth.
