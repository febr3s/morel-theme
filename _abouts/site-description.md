MOREL generates web sites from bibliographic collections. The MOREL sites gather book covers, excerpts, bibliographic clues, metadata and digital downloads from works stored in the Zotero reference manager.

<!-- more -->

Works are organized by dynamic lists, which automatically group the works according to common characteristics:

- [authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/author)
- [city of publication]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/city)
- [imprint or publisher]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/publisher)
- [nationality of authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/nationality)
- [edition date]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/edition)
- [digital repository]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/repository).

MOREL also has a [search engine]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/search) that allows you to find works directly.

# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites

- **Zotero**: Install Zotero reference management software from the [official website](https://www.zotero.org/) and create collections to organize your content.

- **Python**: Install Python programming language from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) based on your operating system. Ensure you have Python version 3.x installed.

- **Jekyll**: Install Jekyll, a static site generator, using your preferred method:
  - For macOS or Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    $ gem install bundler jekyll
    ```
  - For Windows, follow the installation guide provided on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).

## Install the Theme {#install}

- Fork the repository. That is, create a copy in your [Github](https://github.com) account.
- Open your system's terminal in the folder on your local computer where you will be working on the site (Mac and Linux have native terminals. For Windows, you will have to use [WLS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).
- Run `$ git clone http://morelrep.github.io/morel-site-generator` to clone the repository.
- Run `$ cd morel-site-generator` to move to the repository folder
- Run `$ bundle update` to update the theme and its dependencies. If you don't have Ruby on your system, follow the instructions in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- Run `ruby dev.rb` (alternatively, delete `morelrep.github.io/morel-theme` from the `remote_theme:` line in `_config.yml`)
- Run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml --livereload` to run the test site.

## Customize the Site {#configure}

Now you have on your local computer a ready-made site *with sample content, from the MOREL  site Afro Latin American Writers in Translation ([ALAWiT](https://alawit.org))*. You can run it locally to test with `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml --livereload`. 

To fill it with your site's information, follow these steps:

- Open `_config.yml` in your text editor and change:
  - The `title` to your site's.
  - The `tagline` to your site's.
  - The `email` and/or social media accounts to your site's.
  - The `description` to your site's.
  - The `jotform` link (create your free account at [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/)).
- Replace the logo, pattern and avatar files by substituting these files:
  - `assets/img/img/theme/logo.png`
  - `assets/img/img/theme/avatar.jpg`
  - `assets/img/img/theme/pattern.png`
- Open the `podcast.md` file and change the title and tagline of your podcast or blog.
- The `_posts` folder has the MOREL posts. Delete the MOREL posts and create your own with [Jekyll nomenclature](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). If you don't want to add any podcast posts or episodes to your site, change in `_config.yml` the `podcast` value to `false`.

## Generate Content from Zotero {#generate}

- Run `$ jekyll build --config _config_local.yml` to import to the `_sites` folder the updated content generators.
- Run `$ unzip -d ./assets/ ./_site/assets/env.zip` to update the Python environment that generates the contents.
- Open Zotero and review the [guide](#zotero-fields) to make the fields 100 % readable for MOREL.
- Export your Zotero collection as `csv`. If you don't know how to do it follow the instructions [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/exporting). 
- Name your `csv` file as `books_zotero.csv`. Replace the file with the same name found in the `assets/data` folder.
- Run `$ cd assets/env/bin` to go to the folder where the Python environment is activated. Activate it with `$ source activate`.
- Run `$ cd ../src` to move to the folder where the Python scripts are located.
- Run `$ python morel-generate` to generate the content from your Zotero collection.
- Run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml --livereload` to activate the local server for browsing.
- Open the browser and go to the link provided by the local server (usually it's http://127.0.0.1:4000).
- Browse your custom site!

## Deploy {#publish}
- Run `$ ruby prod.rb` (alternatively, add `morelrep.github.io/morel-theme-generator` to the `remote_theme` line:)
- To publish to Github, follow their [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) (ignore the "New repository" step as you are working with your MOREL fork).
- To publish with a third party, follow Jekyll's [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/third-party/).
- To publish to your personal server follow Jekyll's [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/manual/).

## To install the theme as a local Ruby gem, or without code

We are working on instructions and utilities to facilitate these possibilities.

## Zotero fields {#zotero-fields}

MOREL items are added in the same way that items are added in any [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero). In its current version, MOREL can only process items of type `book`. Since not all the fields needed for MOREL are available for the `book` content type, some considerations must be made:

- Excerpt: the fragment from each MOREL record corresponds to the `notes` of Zotero (see the [documentation about the notes](https://www.zotero.org/support/notes) by Zotero). In its current version, MOREL *only accepts one excerpt per book*.
- Cover: the cover is a jpg file that is added as an `attachment` to the Zotero item (see the Zotero attachments [documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files)).
- Translation or original: in order to filter translated books from originals, MOREL uses Zotero's `Series` field to indicate whether it is a translation with the `tr` sign.
- First edition: MOREL uses the `Date` field for the date of publication of the book and the `Edition` field for the date of first edition.

## "About" page for your site

If you aren't using MOREL yet, go to the [installation instructions](#install) above. If you installed MOREL already, these are your last steps to have it ready to run:

- Delete the file `_abouts/site-description.md`
- Duplicate `site-description_template`, and rename it as `site-description.md`. The template has the current description for one of the sites built with MOREL: Afro-Latin American Writers in Translation (ALAWiT). Edit to your site's needs. But note that there are dynamic fields, such as `{{ site.title }}` and `{{ site.books.size }}`. We recommend you to keep them in your edition, so your site description is automatically updated as your collection grows.
- Run `ruby dev.rb` to deactivate the remote theme.
- Run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml --livereload`.
- Move the file `_site/abouts/site-description.html` to `_includes`.
- Remeber to run `ruby prod.rb` if you are going to update your changes to your production GitHub site.
